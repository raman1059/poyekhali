Git (/ɡɪt/[7]) is a version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source-code management in software development,[8] but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision-control system, it is aimed at speed,[9] data integrity,[10] and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.[11]

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.[12] Its current maintainer since 2005 is Junio Hamano.

As with most other distributed version-control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.[13]
